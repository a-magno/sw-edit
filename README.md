# SW Editor
An addon to be used inside the Godot Engine editor together with the SilentWolf addon.

## Installing from Github
1. Download this repo
2. Copy the addons folder to your project.
3. SilentWolf is included due to some small changes made so it can be run inside the editor.
4. Enable the SWEditor plugin.
5. Once enabled, it will ask for your SilentWolf Game ID and API Key. This information is stored locally within your project.

## How to use
Swap to the SWEdit tab above, right next to the AssetLib, search for a player's name and edit their data as much as you want. You can also save it as a JSON file!

Also, it is recommended, if you're using Git for version control, to add .env to your list, if you didn't already.
